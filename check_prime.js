//Verifying a prime number

//A prime number (or a prime) is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors 
//other than 1 and itself. 
//A natural number greater than 1 that is not a prime number is called a composite number.

//The simplest primality test is trial division: Given an input number n, check whether any prime 
//integer m from 2 to âˆšn evenly divides n (the division leaves no remainder). If n is divisible by 
//any m then n is composite, otherwise it is prime.
